 * Base class for all the selection menus in the application.
 * <p>
 * A selection menu is a menu that appears when the screen starts a selection
 * operation. It contains actions that modify the selected items, such as delete
 * or archive. Since it replaces the toolbar, it also has a title.
 * <p>
 * This class hides many implementation details of creating such menus in
 * Android. The interface is supposed to look very similar to {@link BaseMenu},
 * with a few additional methods, such as finishing the selection operation.
 * Internally, it uses an {@link ActionMode}.
