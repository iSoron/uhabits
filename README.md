## Features

* **Simple, beautiful and modern interface.** Loop has a minimalistic interface
  that is easy to use and follows the material design guidelines.

* **Habit score.** In addition to showing your current streak, Loop has an
  advanced algorithm for calculating the strength of your habits. Every
  repetition makes your habit stronger, and every missed day makes it weaker. A
  few missed days after a long streak, however, will not completely destroy
  your entire progress.

* **Detailed graphs and statistics.** Clearly see how your habits improved over
  time with beautiful and detailed graphs. Scroll back to see the complete
  history of your habits.

* **Flexible schedules.** Supports both daily habits and habits with more
  complex schedules, such as 3 times every week; one time every other week; or
  every other day.

* **Reminders.** Create an individual reminder for each habit, at a chosen hour
  of the day. Easily check, dismiss or snooze your habit directly from the
  notification, without opening the app.

* **Optimized for smartwatches.** Reminders can be checked, snoozed or
  dismissed directly from your Android Wear watch.

* **Completely ad-free and open source.** There are absolutely no
  advertisements, annoying notifications or intrusive permissions in this app,
  and there will never be. The complete source code is available under the
  GPLv3.

## Installing

The easiest way to install Loop is through the [Google Play Store][playstore] or [F-Droid][fdroid].
You may also download and install the APK from the [releases page][releases];
note, however, that the app will not be updated automatically.  To build this
app from the source code, see [build instructions][build].

## Contributing

Loop is an open source project developed entirely by volunteers. If you would
like to contribute to the project, you are very welcome. There are many ways to
contribute, even if you are not a software developer.

* **Report bugs, suggest features.** The easiest way to contribute is to simply
  use the app and let us know if you find any problems or have any suggestions
  to improve it. You can either use the link inside the app, or open an issue
  at GitHub. If you would like to receive the newest versions of the app
  earlier than everyone else, [join our open beta on Google Play][beta].

* **Spread the word.** If you like the app, share it with your family, friends
  and colleagues. You can also rate and review the app on Google Play Store, to help
  other users find it more easily.

* **Translate the app into your own language.** If you are not a native English
  speaker, and would like to see the app translated into your own language,
  please join our [open translation project at POEditor][poedit]. If the translation
  is already completed, you are also very welcome to join and proofread it.

* **Write some code.** If you are an Android developer, you are very welcome to
  contribute with code. Please, see the [developer guidelines][dev-guide] for more details.
