      <h3 id="creating-and-tracking-habits">Creating and tracking habits</h3>
      
      <h4 id="how-can-i-track-bad-habits-i-want-to-break">How can I track bad habits I want to break?</h4>
      
      <p>Instead of tracking bad habits, it is better to rephrase your habit in a
      positive way.  In this way, every time you open the app to put a checkmark, you
      are rewarding yourself for some good behavior, instead of getting punished.
      For example, instead of having the bad habit "Did you smoke today?" you could
      have the good habit "Did you have a smoke-free day today?".  Another example,
      instead of "Did you eat junk food today?" you could have "Did you eat healthy
      today?".</p>
      
      <h4 id="how-can-i-specify-that-a-habit-should-be-performed-on-certain-days-of-the-week">How can I specify that a habit should be performed on certain days of the week?</h4>
      
      <p>You don't need to specify this. The app will figure it out by itself. You just
      need to specify how many times would you like to repeat the habit in a certain
      interval of time. For example, if you want to repeat a certain habit every
      Monday and Friday, simply specify that you want to repeat the habit 2 times per
      week, and then start practicing your habit. If, during your first week, you
      indeed perform your habit on Monday and Friday, the app will automatically add
      a checkmark on the following Saturday and Sunday. As long as you keep your
      routine, the checkmarks should appear automatically on the correct days.</p>
      
      <h4 id="when-i-am-creating-a-new-habit-what-am-i-supposed-to-write-on-the-question-field">When I am creating a new habit, what am I supposed to write on the "question" field?</h4>
      
      <p>The question field is a place where you can specify more clearly the
      requirements for the habit. For example, while the title of your habit might
      say "Meditate", the question might ask "Did you meditate for at least 10
      minutes this morning?". This question appears on the reminders.</p>
      
      <h4 id="how-can-i-put-checkmarks-in-past-days">How can I put checkmarks in past days?</h4>
      
      <p>Open the statistics page for a certain habit, scroll down to the "History"
      section and press the button "Edit" located under the calendar. Then, tap on
      the days to check or uncheck. You can also scroll sideways to change days
      further back in time. This feature has been available since version 1.3.0.</p>
      
      <h4 id="how-can-i-see-the-statistics-page-for-a-certain-habit">How can I see the statistics page for a certain habit?</h4>
      
      <p>Just tap on the name of the habit.</p>
      
      <h4 id="how-can-i-reorder-the-habits">How can I reorder the habits?</h4>
      
      <p>First, press-and-hold the name of a habit for a second. Then, when it becomes
      selected, just drag it to the desired place, without lifting your finger.</p>
      
      <h4 id="how-can-i-disable-the-vibration-every-time-i-put-a-checkmark">How can I disable the vibration every time I put a checkmark?</h4>
      
      <p>Loop follows your phone's settings to decide whether it should vibrate on touch
      or not. To disable the vibration, open your phone's settings, tap "Sounds"
      and disable "Vibrate on touch".</p>
      
      <h4 id="why-are-some-checkmarks-gray">Why are some checkmarks gray?</h4>
      
      <p>The color gray indicates that the checkmark was automatically added by the
      app, and not manually by the user. This happens with non-daily habits. For
      example, if you have a habit that should be repeated only one time every week,
      and you perform it on a certain Monday, the app will automatically add gray
      checkmarks on Tuesday, Wednesday an so on.</p>
      
      <h4 id="how-can-i-delete-a-habit">How can I delete a habit?</h4>
      
      <p>On the main screen, press-and-hold the name of the habit for a second. When it
      becomes selected, tap the overflow icon on the menu bar (it looks like three
      vertical dots), then select delete.</p>
      
      <h4 id="how-is-the-score-calculated">How is the score calculated?</h4>
      
      <p>To compute the score of a habit, the app uses a statistical method known as
      exponential smoothing. Basically, it computes a weighted average that takes
      into consideration every repetition of the habit, from the very first day you
      started your habit until today. Recent repetitions, however, are considered
      more important than older ones, and have a larger impact on the score. This
      method has many nice features, including:</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>Every repetition counts, even way back in the past. This is not true for
      other simpler formulas, such as counting how many times have you performed
      the habit in the last week/month/year and then dividing by the number of
      days in that interval.</li>
        <li>If you have a poor habit score, then a few repetitions can bring your score
      up very quickly. As your score improves, however, the reward for each
      repetition gets smaller and smaller, so you have to keep at it if you want
      to see further increases.</li>
        <li>If you have a high score for a very long time and you take a short break,
      it's quite easy to restore your score back to what it was. If you start
      taking frequent breaks, however, then your score will suffer.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h4 id="how-long-will-it-take-to-reach-the-highest-score">How long will it take to reach the highest score?</h4>
      
      <p>If you perform a daily habit perfectly, the score reaches 80% after one month,
      96% after two months and 99% after three months. For non-daily habits, it takes
      longer to reach the same percentages. If your habit is repeated every other
      day, for example, then it takes two months to reach 80%, and if you habit is
      weekly, then it takes seven months.</p>
      
      <h3 id="importing-and-exporting-data">Importing and exporting data</h3>
      
      <h4 id="if-i-uninstall-the-app-will-i-lose-all-my-data">If I uninstall the app, will I lose all my data?</h4>
      
      <p>Yes, uninstalling the app will delete all your data! All files inside the
      folder <code>Android » data » org.isoron.uhabits</code> on the SD card will also be deleted.
      This is the way Android was designed, and there is nothing Loop can do to
      prevent it.</p>
      
      <h4 id="if-my-phone-gets-damaged-or-factory-reset-will-i-lose-all-my-data">If my phone gets damaged or factory reset, will I lose all my data?</h4>
      
      <p>Loop supports Android's native backup service: if you have backups activated in
      your phone settings (Settings » Backup &amp; Restore » Back up my data), it should
      periodically save a copy of your data in the cloud automatically. The data will
      be restored in case you factory-reset your phone or activate a new device.
      <strong>Note however that uninstalling the app will delete all your data, in addition
      to all the backups stored in the cloud</strong>. Furthermore, this backup system can be unreliable at
      times. Therefore, if you want to make sure that your data is safely backed up,
      it is still recommended that you use a specialized backup utility, such as
      Titanium Backup. Alternatively, you can export a full backup of your data
      manually. For more details, see the answer for the next question.</p>
      
      <h4 id="how-can-i-export-a-full-backup-of-my-data">How can I export a full backup of my data?</h4>
      
      <p>Select the option "Export full backup" on the settings screen. A file will be
      generated, and you will be asked to choose an app to share it to. If you select
      an email application, you will be able to send the file as an attachment to
      yourself. If you select Google Drive, Dropbox or similar apps, you will be able
      to upload it. A copy of the generated file is also automatically saved on the
      SD card, inside the folder <code>Android » data » org.isoron.uhabits » files</code>. Be aware that
      this folder will be deleted when the app is uninstalled. If you would like to
      keep the backups on the SD card after the app is uninstalled, you should move
      them to another folder.</p>
      
      <h4 id="how-can-i-restore-a-full-backup">How can I restore a full backup?</h4>
      
      <p>First, you should copy the backup file to the folder
      <code>Android » data » org.isoron.uhabits » files</code> on the SD card.  For security and privacy
      reasons, Loop is only able to read files that are stored inside this folder. To
      copy the file there, you can either connect your phone to your computer or use
      a file manager app. After this is done, open Loop Habit Tracker, open the
      settings menu, select the option "Import data", locate and then tap on the file
      that you just copied. Your data will be restored.</p>
      
      <h4 id="how-can-i-export-my-data-as-csv">How can I export my data as CSV?</h4>
      
      <p>Open the settings screen, scroll down to the section "Database" and select the
      option "Export as CSV". The data will be exported as a ZIP archive containing
      individual comma-separated files for each habit, which can be opened with any
      modern spreadsheet software, such as Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice Calc.</p>
      
      <h4 id="how-can-i-import-data-from-tickmate">How can I import data from Tickmate?</h4>
      
      <p>First, make sure that you have the latest version of Tickmate installed. Open
      Tickmate, click on the menu, select the option "Backup database" and click OK.
      Your data will be saved to a file inside the folder <code>Tickmate</code> on the SD card.
      Next, you should move this file to the folder <code>Android » data »&#x000A;org.isoron.uhabits » files</code> on the SD card. For security and privacy reasons,
      Loop is only able to read files that are stored inside this folder. To move the
      file, you can either connect your phone to your computer or use a file manager
      app. After this is done, open Loop Habit Tracker, open the settings menu,
      select the option "Import data", locate and then tap on the file that you just
      copied. Your data will be imported.</p>
      
      <h4 id="how-can-i-import-data-from-rewire">How can I import data from Rewire?</h4>
      
      <p>Since Rewire has recently started to apply password protection on its backup
      files, only older versions of these files can be imported. If you have
      generated a backup file using an older version of Rewire, there should be a
      file named <code>Habits.db</code> inside the folder <code>habit_backup</code> on the SD card.  To
      import it into Loop, you should move this file to the folder <code>Android » data »&#x000A;org.isoron.uhabits » files</code> on the SD card. For security and privacy reasons, Loop is
      only able to read files that are stored inside this folder. To move the file,
      you can either connect your phone to your computer or use a file manager app.
      After this is done, open Loop Habit Tracker, open the settings menu, select the
      option "Import data", locate and then tap on the file that you just copied.
      Your data will be imported.</p>
      
      <h4 id="how-can-i-import-data-from-habitbull">How can I import data from HabitBull?</h4>
      
      <p>First, make sure that you have the latest version of HabitBull installed. Also
      note that, in order to export your data from HabitBull, you need to have the
      premium version of the app. Open HabitBull, tap the menu icon on the upper
      right corner of the screen, then tap export. The app will generate a file, that
      you should copy to the folder <code>Android » data » org.isoron.uhabits » files</code> on the SD card.
      For security and privacy reasons, Loop is only able to read files that are
      stored inside this folder. To copy the file there, you can either connect your
      phone to your computer or use a file manager app. After this is done, open Loop
      Habit Tracker, open the settings menu, select the option "Import data", locate
      and then tap on the file that you just copied.  Your data will be imported.</p>
      
      <h3 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3>
      
      <h4 id="why-are-the-reminders-not-working">Why are the reminders not working?</h4>
      
      <p>There are many reasons why the reminders may not appear:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Loop will only show you a reminder if the task has not been already completed
      that day. For example, if your reminder is scheduled to show up at 8am, but
      you already added a checkmark manually (on the main app) at 7am, then the
      reminder will not appear.  The same is true for non-daily habits. If you have
      a weekly habit, and you complete it on a certain Monday, the reminder will
      only appear on the following Monday.</li>
        <li>When you create a habit, you can also choose what days are the reminder
      allowed to appear. If you create a weekly habit, but set the reminders to
      appear only on the weekends, for example, then they will never appear Monday
      to Friday, regardless of you having completed the habit during the weekend or
      not.</li>
        <li>If you are sure that the reminders should appear, but they don't, please,
      make sure that your phone has no task killers or RAM boosters installed.
      These apps are known to disable Loop's reminders. If your phone has an
      aggressive power saving mode, such as Samsung's Ultra Power Saving mode or
      Sony's Stamina Mode, please make sure that Loop is whitelisted.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4 id="i-cant-find-loops-widgets-on-the-list-how-can-i-add-them">I can't find Loop's widgets on the list. How can I add them?</h4>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Some phones don't display the name of the app the widgets belong to.  In that
      case, the widgets will be called simply "Checkmark", "Frequency", "Habit
      Strength", "History" and "Streaks".</li>
        <li>If you still can't find the widgets, make sure that Loop is not installed on
      the SD card. Moving apps to the SD card disables many features, including
      widgets.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 id="other-questions">Other questions</h3>
      
      <h4 id="how-can-i-donate-to-the-project">How can I donate to the project?</h4>
      
      <p>Loop currently does not accept any monetary donations. There are many other
      ways you can contribute to the project, however, even if you are not a software
      developer, such as providing feedback, finding bugs, sharing the app with your
      friends, rating and writing a review on Google Play Store, or translating the
      app into your language. Please, <a href="https://github.com/iSoron/uhabits/">see our webpage at GitHub</a> for
      more details.</p>
